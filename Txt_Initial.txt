I am making an inventory system
 I need it to ask the user if they want to (1-Add Item, 2-Remove Item, 3-Edit Item, 4-View Inventory, 5-Orders, 0-Quit). 
 
 Add item needs to ask the following: Item Name, SKU, and Price. 
 
 Remove Item needs to ask for SKU to remove. 
 
 Edit Item needs to ask for the SKU then ask what the user would like to edit (1-Name, 2-SKU, 3-Price, 0-Cancel) 
 Then it needs to make the change to all of the items with the same SKU. 
 
 View inventory needs to show the current inventory, and needs to show correct count of items with the same SKU. 
 
 Quit saves the current inventory and says thank you for using the inventory system and the program ends. 
 
 I need some time to determine how I want the order system to work.
