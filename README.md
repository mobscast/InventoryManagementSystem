This is an Inventory Management Project that I made in Python. 
It is a command prompt-based application. 
It has multiple basic abilities and I am working on adding more to it over time. 
This program was made in Visual Studio Code.

Thank you for looking at my project and if you find any issues with it please post it and if you have any ideas to make it better post them as well.
